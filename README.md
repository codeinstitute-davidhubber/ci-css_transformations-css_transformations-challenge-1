description: **'Make an image double in size when you hover over it but don’t make it jump. Use a transition to make the transformation smooth. The transition should happen within 1 second, and the transition-timing-function should be set to ease-in. In the hint tab, you'll find a link to boilerplate files to help get you started.'**
